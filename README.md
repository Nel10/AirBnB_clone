## Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

#### First step: command interpreter to manage objects in AirBnB.

In this project the console will be a single-use function. A command line interface, from which you can create, modify and delete objects in the file store.

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
